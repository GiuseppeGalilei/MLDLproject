# Understanding the Main Challenges of Federated Learning
## Machine Learning and Deep Learning - DSE @ PoliTO a.a. 2021-2022
Goals:
* implement a **centralized baseline** to define an upper bound
* implement a **federated baseline** (FedAvg)
* simulate **system heterogeneity** (FedGKT)
* simulate a **gradient inversion attack**
* explore in more depth a topic among: statistical heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, and privacy and security in a federated scenario
